### **2. Neural Network Architecture**

#### **Dynamic and Modular Design**
```python
class DetailedNeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, layer_dims: List[int]):
        self.layers = []
        for l in range(1, len(layer_dims)):
            layer = NeuralLayer(layer_dims[l-1], layer_dims[l])
            self.layers.append(layer)
            activation = "sigmoid" if l == len(layer_dims)-1 else "relu"
            self.layers.append(ActivationLayer(activation))
```
- **Custom Implementation**: Flexibility for new layers or activation functions.
- **Optimization**: Uses the Adam optimizer for gradient descent.
- **Batch Training**: Efficient model training.

### **3. Comprehensive Data Processing System**

#### **Feature Engineering**
Incorporates new boxing-specific features:
```python
def create_difference_features(df):
    df['weight_diff'] = df['fighter1_weight'] - df['fighter2_weight']
    df['height_diff'] = df['fighter1_height'] - df['fighter2_height']
    df['reach_diff'] = df['fighter1_reach'] - df['fighter2_reach']
    df['power_diff'] = df['fighter1_power'] - df['fighter2_power']
    return df
```
- Calculates differences in physical attributes.
- Estimates stamina and damage efficiency per hit.
- Captures fighter styles with ratios of punch types.

#### **Normalization and Cross-Validation**
- Standardizes features for model consistency.
- Utilizes stratified splits for training and validation.
